# Five words
### What this is 
This is a simple web based application that allows Dr. Wilkes to collect five words from kids in the class and display the results as a word cloud on the projector.

This project was developed in an hour with a simple backend in Node.js. The frontend is done with a simple AJAX polling mechanism. The wordcloud is generated with [wordcloud2.js](https://github.com/timdream/wordcloud2.js/).
